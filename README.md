# C++ examples

blocking_queue.cpp - thread safe queue, can handle any type of objects, via universal reference. In the implemented threading mechanism, waiting thread sleeps and doesn't occupy hardware. An advantage of the condvar implementation.

asynch_function_call.cpp - example code to make a function call of any object, in a thread, without any changes in the class.
